title: About Private Data Donor
---

Private Data Donor is a tool connecting volunteers with researchers.
Its objective is to monitor search queries (from Google) performed by volunteers, in order to study the spread of infectious diseases like flu.
Unlike existing solutions, we want to do it in a privacy-preserving way, which means that the data we are not able to link the data we collect back to individuals.
Moreover, volunteers remain in control of their data, and all our process is clearly documented on this website.

We enforce a strict control over the collected data.
In particular, information provided by volunteers will never be used for commercial purposes, or 
shared outside of the partners of the i-sense project.

For any question or inquiry, you can contact us at [&#112;&#100;&#100;&#105;&#115;&#101;&#110;&#115;&#101;&#064;&#117;&#099;&#108;&#046;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#117;&#107;](&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#112;&#100;&#100;&#105;&#115;&#101;&#110;&#115;&#101;&#064;&#117;&#099;&#108;&#046;&#097;&#099;&#046;&#117;&#107;).

## The i-sense project
Private Data Donor is part of the [i-sense project](https://www.i-sense.org.uk), which is a 
interdisciplinary research collaboration funded by the EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council), 
UK's main agency for funding research in engineering and the physical sciences.
i-sense aims to identify outbreaks of infectious disease much earlier than ever before, helping 
patients gain faster access to care and protecting population.

This project gathers several partners, among which University College London, Imperial College London, 
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Newcastle University, the University of Surrey and Public Health England.

## University College London
Private Data Donor has been developed by the [Information Security Research Group](http://sec.cs.ucl.ac.uk). 
They are particularly interested in addressing key technical aspects of information security and privacy - such as cryptography and system security.

The data collected by the Private Data Donor is then exploited by the [Media Futures Research Group](https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/researchGroup/1147)
Their research interests include information retrieval, digital rights management, and statistical modelling of the structural topology of information sources.

Both research groups are part of the department of Computer Science at the [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk).
