## About
Private Data Donor is a research project whose goal is to gather statistics about Web search queries in a privacy-preserving way.
Collected data is then used to help monitoring and predicting outbreaks of infectious diseases such as flu.
It is developed by [UCL's CS department](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/), in the frame of the [i-sense project](https://www.i-sense.org.uk/), the EPSRC IRC in Early Warning Sensing Systems for Infectious Diseases.
