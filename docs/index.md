# Private Data Donor

Private Data Donor is a tool connecting volunteers with researchers.
Its objective is to monitor search queries (from Google) performed by volunteers, in order to study the spread of infectious diseases like flu.
Unlike existing solutions, we want to do it in a privacy-preserving way, which means that the data we are not able to link the data we collect back to individuals.
Moreover, volunteers remain in control of their data, and all our process is clearly documented on this website.

This website contains the technical documentation of the platform.
It is targeted towards [system administrators](deploy), who are interested in installing and maintaining an instance, and [developers](contribute), who are willing to contribute to the source code.
Alternatively, can reach the general audience website at [https://ppd.cs.ucl.ac.uk](https://ppd.cs.ucl.ac.uk).

## The i-sense project

Private Data Donor is part of the [i-sense project](https://www.i-sense.org.uk), which is a 
interdisciplinary research collaboration funded by the EPSRC (Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council), 
UK's main agency for funding research in engineering and the physical sciences.
i-sense aims to identify outbreaks of infectious disease much earlier than ever before, helping 
patients gain faster access to care and protecting population.

This project gathers several partners, among which University College London, Imperial College London, 
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Newcastle University, the University of Surrey and Public Health England.
