title: Get started with Private Data Donor
---

This page is a quickstart guide design to help you getting started with the Private Data Donor program.
You will learn how to install the Chrome extension on your computer, and start helping the science by joining a collection campaign.
Thank you for your help!

## 1. Install the extension

The first step to get started is to install the Google Chrome extension.
As of now, we only support Google Chrome, but could develop extensions for other web browsers if our initiative receives enough traction.
Please let us know if you would like to see another web browser supported!

The extension is distributed via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).

You simply have to click on the "Add to Chrome" button.
The extension then asks you for a single permission: to read and change your browsing history.

We need to have access to your browsing in order to monitor the search queries you perform.
But do not worry, you can [view the data we collect](./history) in real-time and even delete a search query before it is sent if you do not want to share it with us.
Moreover, most of the collection campaigns come with [a privacy-preserving encryption layer](./privacy) that helps protect your privacy.

## 2. You're done!

Once the extension is installed, you are pretty much done.
Now, the PDD extension is running and monitoring your search queries in the background.
Your browser will automatically contact our server about once a day to get instructions about which queries are actually being monitoring, and send back collect data.
 
The extension also comes with an interface providing answers to the questions you may have, as well as some insights about what the extension is doing.
These options can be accessed by clicking on the extension's logo that should have appeared at the right-hand side of the address bar.

If this button is not visible, you may alternatively access the options by using [Chrome's extensions page](chrome://extensions/).
