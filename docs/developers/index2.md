Enormous data sets are being collected from diverse sources such as mobile phones, and people’s interactions with traditional and web-based services for traveling, shopping, communicating, and searching.
Recent work has determined that these data sets can be analyzed to reveal information about medicines and people’s health and behaviours.
At the same time, the web has provided new ways to communicate with people, e.g. Twitter and Facebook. The scale of these new communication platforms is enormous - the number of monthly active Facebook users exceeds 1.4 billion.
Our vision is to exploit these new data sources and communications channels to dramatically improve surveillance of, and responses to infectious diseases.
A major challenge to do so is access to data.
Private Data Donor (PDD) is a system enabling volunteers to provide data for research purposes.
It is facilitating the automatic submission of data from users.
The submitted data correspond to the numbers of times a user has performed search engine queries of certain types. The data is sent to a central server.
Submitted data is protected with a privacy preserving cryptographic protocol solving the problem of efficient private aggregation.
